        <h2><span style="color : blueviolet;">AWS Student Admin</span></h2>
        <p>The aim of this project is to replicate a robust Student Administration System, initially developed for the University of Connecticut's CSE2102 course, Section 3, Group 7. Leveraging AWS cloud-based infrastructure, including DynamoDB, Lambda, and REST API, among others, on the backend, and Vue.js on the frontend, we've created a streamlined and intuitive user interface. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey, showcasing not only my technical skills but also my ability to effectively tackle complex challenges and deliver results.

        <h2><span style="color : blueviolet;">Portfolio Website</span></h2>
        <p>This is the website you are currently visiting, however I wanted to take a moment to explain the process of its creation. As this is the first personal project I have created with the intent to be shown to others, designing a functioning and visually appealing website was very important to me. Although it may not incorporate the most cutting-edge technologies, I take pride in the effort I put into its development.

        <h2><span style="color : blueviolet;">Research Papers</span></h2>
        <p>This section contains some of my written works, where I have served as the primary contributor. These writings were completed during my studies at the University of Connecticut for the CSE 3500 Algorithms and Complexity course, as well as during my tenure as a researcher at NIUVT. The first document is a completed research paper on the Rabin-Karp algorithm. The second and third documents are partially completed research papers stemming from my work at NIUVT. These pieces demonstrate my proficiency in researching and articulating complex topics in appropriate formats. They not only highlight my skills as a computer scientist but, more importantly, underscore my ability as an effective communicator.</p>
