        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Luke Pepin and I am dedicated Computer Science undergraduate student. I am pursuing a duel concentration in both Cybersecurity and Software Design. I am driven by my passion for problem solving and prefer to lead by example.</p>

        <h2>Background and Approach</h2>
        <p>My background blends my strong work ethic with very unique experiences. Working in jobs where others in the Computer Science field might never consider. First working as a custodian for the high school with I graduated from months earlier. Then later my time as a teaching assistant for students with special needs. Both roles have influenced my understanding of leadership, organization, and punctuality. Invaluable skills which I continue to apply and develop in all my endeavors.</p>

        <p>Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at the University of Connecticut. Focusing on two concentrations in Cybersecurity and Software Design. As a result, I have studied a diverse array of coursework. Ranging from Object-Oriented Design to Network Security. Alongside my academic pursuits, I've involved myself in projects to expand my skills. One of which is this website were you currently are now. Others with are visible by clicking the Projects tab above.</p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>My professional journey revolves around my work as Researcher for The National Institute for Undersea Vehicle Technology (NIUVT). During which I've developed skills in formal research procedures and literature review processes. As a researcher I've worked on topics that I'd had little to no prior experience in. This experience has sharpened my adaptability and problem-solving skills. With hopes to become published soon the reports will be available to view in the Projects tab above.</p>

        <h2>Skills and Certifications</h2>
        <p>From my education and personal projects I've developed a multitude of technical skills. Such as programming in Python, Java, C and others. Cloud based services with AWS. Making use of microcontrollers with Arduino. Proper software development practices and methodologies such as Agile Development and Code Reviews.  All while developing my soft skills like teamwork, leadership, problem-solving, and communication.</p>

        <h2>Involvement and Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of academic and professional endeavors. I am very passionate professional sport fan and enjoy going to gym.
